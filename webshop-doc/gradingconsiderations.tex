\subsection{Considerations in grading}
The following aspects are considered in grading the SEN1 part:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item The functionality, efficiency and effectiveness of the
  tests. In other words: the proper amount of tests, to cover each
  aspect of the method under test and development.
\item Whether the way of working (order of commits) can be considered
  \textbf{``test driven''}. This mostly depends on if you committed
  the test red and then green.
\item Are the tests real? This is measured by breaking the system
  under test, to verify that at least one test turns red for every
  break in the implementation.
\item The code coverage of the student implementation by means of the
  students test.
\end{itemize}

The complexity of the aspects is weighted in the grading. Preliminary
weights are available in the code.
